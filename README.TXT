GWTUpload & JSUpload

GWTUpload is a library for uploading files to web servers, showing a progress bar with real information about the process (file size, bytes transferred, etc). It uses ajax requests to ask the web server for the upload progress. It has two components written in java, the server side with servlet and utility classes, and the client side that is compiled into javascript using gwt.

JSUpload is the same client library but compiled and exported into javascript, so non java developers can use it directly in web pages. I've written an article describing the technique used to do this. JSUpload provides a server program coded in perl that can be installed in any web server as a cgi-bin script.

GWTUpload-GAE is a library including a special servlet to handle uploads in Google Application Engine servers (GAE).
